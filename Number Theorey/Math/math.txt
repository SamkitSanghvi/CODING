prime no :- 2,3,5,7,11,13....

Modulo Property 
ðŸŒŸ (a+b) % m = ((a%m)+(b%m)) % m
ðŸŒŸ (a+b) % m = ((a%m)-(b%m) + m) % m
ðŸŒŸ (a*b) % m = ((a%m)*(b%m)) % m
ðŸŒŸ (a/b) % m = ((a%m)*(b^-1 %m)) % m
ðŸŒŸ (a%m) % m = (a % m)
ðŸŒŸ m^x % m = 0  x>0

b^-1 % m  = multiplicative modulo inversion  = b and m are coPrimes = only 1 common factor i.e is 1

hcf of a and b is = min value of equation ax + by (x and y are integers)

whatever hcf will you get
