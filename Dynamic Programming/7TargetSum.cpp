/*
                Target Sum 
Assign +/- sign before every number such that the sum of whole array is equal to given sum
+1 -1 -2 + 3 = 1
-1 + 1 -2 + 3 = 1
+1 +1 +2 - 3 = 1
Output :- Count the total such Combination 

input :- arr = [1,1,2,3]
sum = 1;
Output :- 3
*/

/*
    Approach
    +1 -1 -2 + 3 = 1
    (1,3) - (1,2) 

    Same as probelm 6CountSubsetWithGivenDifference

    This Problem is One Step Ahead of 6CountSubsetWithGivenDifference

    7TargetSum = 6CountSubsetWithGivenDifference
