In summary,
1. LRU Cache Problem
    - Hashmaps
    - Doubly linked list
2. Allocate Minimum no of pages / Painters Partition Problem
    - Binary Search on answer
3. Min cost problem
    - DP-Matrix problems
    - Matrix problems
    - DFS / BFS problems
4. Longest common subsequence (DP)
    - longest common substring
5. Knapsack problem (DP)
    - Subset sum problem
6. Matrix Chain Multiplication (DP)
    - Very common concept for many problems
7. Flatten a linked list
    - usually there is next pointer in LinkedList, but here there is bottom pointer concept
8. Merge 2 sorted Linked List
9. Graph Algorithms
   - DFS, BFS, Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, Bellman Ford's
10. Find the largest BST (Binary Trees)
