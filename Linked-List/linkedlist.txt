Linked-List is a Linear Data structure Which is a collection of Node 
(Data + address of Next node)

why ?? 
1. arr [10] ---> 100 ‚ùå we can't change the size of array at run time because
2. vecto<int> arr(5) 
--> if the size of vector is full it will create a new vector of double the size of current size and store the value --> new Storage + value copy

3. Linked List
1. Dynamic Data structure (grow and shrink at run time) --->  No Memory Wastage
2. Insertion and Deletion is Easy ---> No shift Needed


[Head]--->[5|710] ---> [8|810]---> [12|910]----> [13|Null]
             710          810           910

Types Of Linked List
1.Singly LL
2.Doubly LL
3.Circular LL
4.Doubly Circular LL
